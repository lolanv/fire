1. **Permit.h**:
    - This header file defines the `Permit` class.
    - `Permit` class represents a permit with two private data members: `_permit_number` (string) and `_permit_duration_remaining` (integer).
    - It provides a constructor to initialize the permit with a permit number and its duration remaining.
    - Public member functions `getPermitNumber()` and `getPermitDurationRemaining()` are declared to access the private data members.

2. **Permit.cpp**:
    - This source file contains the implementation of the member functions declared in the `Permit` class.
    - It defines the constructor and implements the getter functions to retrieve the permit number and duration remaining.

3. **TransportVehicle.h**:
    - This header file defines the `TransportVehicle` class.
    - `TransportVehicle` class represents a vehicle with associated permit, vehicle type, seat count, and stops count.
    - It contains private data members `_permit` (shared pointer to `Permit`), `_vehicle_type`, `_seat_count`, and `_stops_count`.
    - The constructor initializes the vehicle with a permit, vehicle type, seat count, and stops count.
    - Public member functions are declared to access the private data members.

4. **TransportVehicle.cpp**:
    - This source file contains the implementation of the member functions declared in the `TransportVehicle` class.
    - It defines the constructor and implements the getter functions to retrieve the permit, vehicle type, seat count, and stops count.

5. **Functionalities.h**:
    - This header file declares functions for various operations on a collection of `TransportVehicle` instances.
    - Functions are declared to create transport vehicles, find and display permit number at a specific index, find and print the average seat count for a given vehicle type, and find and print whether all vehicles have the same vehicle type.

6. **Functionalities.cpp**:
    - This source file contains the implementations of the functions declared in the `Functionalities.h` header.
    - Functions are implemented using STL algorithms and perform the specified operations on the collection of `TransportVehicle` instances.

7. **Main.cpp**:
    - This file contains the `main()` function, which serves as the entry point of the program.
    - It includes necessary header files and defines the `main()` function.
    - Inside `main()`, it creates a vector of shared pointers to `TransportVehicle` instances, calls functions from `Functionalities` to perform operations on the vehicles, and launches threads to execute these functions concurrently.
    - Finally, it joins the threads and returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.

Overall, the code demonstrates the use of classes, shared pointers, STL algorithms, and multithreading in C++ to manage and manipulate a collection of transport vehicles. It provides functionality to create vehicles, retrieve permit information, calculate average seat count, and check if all vehicles have the same type.
