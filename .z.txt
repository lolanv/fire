Create a function FillData to generate an RXC dimension array of interger where R and C represent row and column
count respectively (taken as input form the user). Accept RXC inputs from the user and fill the array.

For eg: The input Sequence
            2
            2
            10
            20
            30
            40

Should create this matrix of values

    10              20
    30              40


Create an Adaptor function that accepts the following parameters
    a) A value R represnting the count of rows in the 2D array.
    b) A value C represnting the count of column in the 2D array.
    c) A pointer to an array of interger(represnting the values generated in the FillData function).
    d) A function wrapper to any function matching the following signature
        1) 2 interger values (for R and C as descrived above) along with the pointer to an array of interger.
        2) Return type of the function Should be void.


Invoke the Adaptor function by passing the following function as parameters to it


    1) A function that takes the bove matrix as input, and display the sum of values in each row.

    For E.g For the matrix above , console Should display
            30
            70
    
    2) A function that display the higest value from the input matrix on the console.

    For E.g For the matrix above, console Should display 40.

    3) Lambda Function that display the square of the number ayt the last position of the matrix.
    For E.g For the matrix above, console Should display 1600

    4) Lambda function that prints the maxium number in the each column of the matrix

    For E.g For the Matrix above, console Should display
            30
            40


Note: Create the appropriate main function to demostrate all functioalities

Write code in morder cpp and Create a functioalities.h and functioalities.cpp and main.cpp files
