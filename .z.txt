Create a class CarUnit with the attribute:

std::string m_car_brand;
float m_car_price;
CarType m_car_type;(SEDAN,SUV,HATCHBACK)
int m_car_top_speed;
int m_car_rpm;
CarGear m_car_gear_system;(PRNDL,TIPTRONIC,CLASSIC)


Create a follwing function in a functionalities.cpp fie:

1) A function which Create at least 5 instance in a container which uses a unique std::syting ID attribute as key
    with shared pointer to CarUnit instance being the value in the hashtable bucket.

2) A function which check wheather all instance in the data container have the same gear system or not (all 
    instance must have the same m_car_gear_system value, types should not taken as input from the user)

3) A function to return a container of instance whose m_car_type matches with the value passed as parameter to this function.

4) A function to find and return m_car_price of the instance whose m_car_top_speed is lowest.

5) A function to return the m_car_rpm value for all instance whose ID is passed as a parameter.(ID
    should match with the key of the instance stored in the container)

6) A function to return the count of instance whose m_car_price is above a threshold value (given while
    calliing the function as parameter)


Note:
1) Create special function as per requriment
2) All Corner Case for functionalities must be handled using std::nullopt and std::optional types.
3) All data processing operations must be performed using STL algorithms.
4) Demostrate functionalities by Createing a sutaible main.cpp file
