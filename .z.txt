Create the following in Functionalities.cpp file

1) A function the accept a container of interger and return the sum of first 3 numbers in the container .
    For Example, a container of values {1,2,3,4,5 } would return the value 6.

2) A function that accept a container of interger and return the minium numbers amongst the last 3 numbers in the  container.
    For Example a containerof value{1,2,3,4,5} would return the value 3.

3) A functionto to accept a container of interger and return a container of all prime numbers form the given input value.
    For Example a container of value {1,2,3,4,5} would return the value {2,3,5}

4) A function to accept a container of interger and a predicate lambda function. the function should return a container of interger
    which pass the condition of the predicate (return true for predicate applied). For Example a container of value {1,2,3,4,5} along with a predicate
    [](int num){return num%2==0;} would return {2,4}.

5) A function to accept a containerof string and return the string with the maxium amount of Characerts in it.
    For Example a container os string {"C++" ,"Coding" , "Demo"} would return the value "Coding".

6) A function to accept a container of string and return a container of non-vowel Characerts from the input
    string value. For Example , a container of string {"C++" ,"Coding" , "Demo"} would return 
    {'C' , '+' ,'+','C','d','n','g','D','m'}.



Note:

    1. Use std::async to execute each functionality in a seprate thread.
    2. Handle corner cases with std::optional and std::future_error whenever applicable.
