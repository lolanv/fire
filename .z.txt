Create a Vehicel with the following attribute:

_vehicel_milegae which is a float
_vehicel_fuel_capacity which is a float
_vehicel_cost which is a float
_vehicel_driver which is a refference wrapper to an instance of Driver created in stack memory


creat a class Driver with the following attribute:

_driver_lience_type which of LMV,HMV or BOTH
_driver_experience_year which is an unsigned interger
_driver_rating which is a float and must be between 1 to 15 (This restriction must be applied to avoid objcet getting created with value beyond this range).


Create a functioalities.cpp section:

    1) A function CreateObject to creat at leat 3 instance of Vehicel class on the heap using a shred_ptr
        to Vehicel for each instance created.
    2) A function CountInstance that can display the count of Vehicel instance whose _vehicel_milegae value is above threshold value provided as a parameter to the function.
    3) A function to return a boolean to indicate whether all instance jhave an associated _driver_rating of above 4.0 or not
    4) A function to find all instance whose _driver_lience_type is LMV and return a container of shred_ptr such Vehicel instance.
    5) A function ComputeDriveSalary which display a value corresponding to each Vehicel instance based on the following
        creta:

        1) For a Vehicel instance whose associated Driver has _driver_rating above 4, value to be displayed should
            be 4 times the _driver_experience_year value
        2) For all other instance, value to be displayed should be 3 times _driver_experience_year
    6) A function AddInstance that accepts all required data as function parameter and add a new instance to the
        data container (Function should allow a user to add more instance to the data container by passing parameter to the function).


Note: 

1. Demostrate each functioality vy creating sutiable client sie code.
2. Handle all possible cases.
