creae a class Device having:

_device_id which is a string
_device_type which is either INFOTAINMENT,ACCESSORY,SAFETY
_device_battery_level which must be an interger value between 1 to 100.
_device_driver which is a pointer to an instance of type DeviceDriver.
A fuction to find _batter_drain_factor which return a float value based on the floowing condition:


1) if Device is of _device_type INFOTAINMENT or ACCESSORY , value sholud be 0.25.

2) Id Device is of _device_type SAFETY, value sholud be 0.5, if current _device_battery_level is above 50 else it sholud be 0.4.


Create a class DeviceDriver with the following attributes.

1) _version_number which is a string value.
2) _release_quarter which could be Q1,Q2,Q3 or Q4.
3) _size_in_bytes which is a float value

Create a functionalites.cpp file:

1) A function to Create 5 instance of Device type on the heap using shared_ptr.
2) A function to find and return the _device_id of all instance in a container which return _batter_drain_factor value below 0.4
3) A function to check if all Device instance are of the same _device_type or not and return a boolean accordingly.
4) A function to display the lowest and heigst _size_in_bytes amongst instance whose _release_quarter is either Q1 or Q4 [Consider only Q1 and Q4 _release_quarter instance for computing the result].
5) A function to find and return the _version_number of all DeviceDriver for the instance whose _device_id matches with the id value provided as a parameter to the function.
6) A function to delete heap allocations if you have created instance using raw pointer
