Create a class EvCar which having attribute.


std::string m_car_id;
    int m_battery_charging_time;
    Platfrom m_platfrom; {PURE_EV or IC_BASED}
    float m_chassos_length;
    int m_seat_count;
    int m_top_speed;

Create following function in Functionalities.cpp file

1) A function Create at leat 5 instance in a container that stores data contiguously. instance must be created
    on the heap and must be managed by smart pointer(std::shared_ptr)

2) A function to find and return std::list of first N instance form the input container where N is taken as an input parameter.(Consider invalid N value corner case appropriately).

3) A function to find and return the m_top_speed of the EvCar instance form container whose m_car_id is passed as a parameter.

4) A function to find and return count of instance whose m_chassos_length is above 2.7f.

5) A function to return the container of all instance from the input data which satisfy a predicate. (passed as a fiunction pointer or lambda function).

6) A function to find and return a boolean to indeicate wheather at leat one input data instance has m_platfrom value as a PURE_EV.


Note: 
a) Create special member function as per requriment.

b) All corner case for Functionalities must be handle using std::nullopt and std::optional

c) All data processing operation must be performed using STL algorithm.

d) Demostrate Functionalities by createing a sutaible Main.cpp file

Create a .h and .cpp file for each class and Functionalities .h and .cpp and main.cpp file
